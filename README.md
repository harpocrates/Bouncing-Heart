# Instructions
Draw a heart (or really any shape) by holding your mouse down as you trace the outline of the desired heart. Once done, the heart should be filled. Then, click and drag to throw it around and watch it bounce and spin off the walls. To catch it/throw it again, click on it and drag.

# Pending developments
Make the heart shatter into pieces (pieces won't interact with each other, just with walls and floor) after a threshold of total impulse transferred.
